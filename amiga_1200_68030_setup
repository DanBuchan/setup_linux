# Amiga installation

There are some ancillary files in the amiga/ folder in this repo

## Prep CF Card and format

See CF_card_notes.txt in amiga/ folder

## WINUAE BOOT NOTES

This section not relevant for real hardware, just a reminder, for winUAE config and backup

1. Use my "Default CF Card" configuration in winUAE
2. System DIR on CF Card should show up as "Workbench32"
3. System DIR on a backup hdf should show up as "Workbench31_backup", use 'add hardfile' with the pfs2aio file system, turn off bootable and give IDE identity that doesn't clash with boot disk. Might have to mount as uaehf. My file is called final_backup.hdf. You should fast format it.

With this set up backup my workbench install by just copying the entire contents of WorkBench31 to Workbench31_backup

To boot from the CF card use the HDD config in the "Configuration", see point 1

If you want to boot with the backup hdf, set device to DH0, Boot Priority "0", Bootable: True, Driver IDE(Auto) 0.

## Installation

NOTE: Anytime you want to start again you can boot with a Workbench Install floppy, format the Workbench31 partition and start again

1. Install Workbench 3.2 as normal

### Basic Config

1. Open Workbench32 and show hidden and snapshot
2. Open Prefs/Screen Mode: High Res Laced, 64 colours
4. Prefs/ run Full Pallette to fix colours

### Install basic programs/tools

1. Install LHA (if not done so for whdload)
2. Install ehide.device to DEVS: (for the extra IDE on the TF1230)
3. Install Mounter to C:
		
### Install 68030 performance patches, http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=113253

1. CopyMemAIO. Copy to C:, then run in S:startup-sequence before DF0 assign check as C:CopyMemAIO
2. SaferPatches. Copy to C: and in S:Startup-sequence  before DF0 assign check add `SaferPatches Install >NIL:`
3. Copy StackAttack_020 to C:, add `C:StackAttack_020` to S:Startup-sequence  before DF0 assign check, and `StackAttack_020 AUTO` before LOADWB
4. FBlit. Copy FBlit and FBlitGui to C:, add fblit.library to Libs:. Then add 'C:Fblit', to S:startup-sequence after ENV: assignment (before Binddrivers)
5. BlazeWCP. Copy BlazaWCP to C:, add to s:startup-sequence after  before DF0 assign check (and after FBlit?)
6. VBRControl. Copy VBRControl to C:. Add `C:VBRControl ON QUIET` to s:startup-sequence after before DF0 assign check
7. Executive. Just follow the installer. I placed everything in SYS: but maybe elsewhere would be sensible. (If you run OS 3.2 or OS 3.2.1 you need to set the ramlib task to NoSchedule in ExecutivePrefs, otherwise the system will hang). You can always disable by editing s:startup-sequence

### Install Programs

1. Installed DOPUS4 to SYS:Tools/ (http://aminet.net/package/util/dopus/DOpus416JRbin)
2. Install sysinfo (http://sysinfo.d0.se/) to Workbench31:Tools/
3. Install MUI3.9 (https://github.com/amiga-mui/muidev) to Workbench31: drive. Doublecheck mui.key is in S:, if not copy it over

#### Configure WHDLoad

1. Edit S:WHDLoad.prefs changed quit key to DEL: $46
2. Uncomment MMU for 68030 operation

### Install Network software

1. http://aminet.net/package/comm/tcp/AmiFTP, to SYS:Tools/
2. AmiSSL, https://github.com/jens-maus/amissl, to SYS:
3. IBrowse, https://www.ibrowse-dev.net/, to SYS:Tools/
4. CardInfo, just moved to C:
4. Install Roadie (http://aminet.net/package/comm/net/Roadie) to SYS:Tools/
5. Install NetMon (http://aminet.net/package/comm/net/netmon) to SYS:Tools/
6. Install amispeedtest (http://aminet.net/package/comm/net/AmiSpeedTest) to SYS:Tools/
7. ReqToolsUsr, http://aminet.net/package/util/libs/ReqToolsUsr, just followed installer
8. ClassAct2Demo, http://aminet.net/package/dev/gui/ClassAct2Demo. Just followed installer with defaults

#### Network configuration

DO THIS ON THE ACTUAL AMIGA WITH THE NETWORK HARDWARE AND NOT ON THE EMULATION
The Prism2 install is somewhat patterned after this (https://youtu.be/soGfXh0CIY0?si=ryDUEwP-W0v3E11o)
When you install prism2v2 it builds access keys for the router. If your keys are invalid it'll make them again with each connection and slow down your connection. If you change things then it is worth reinstalling so the keys are regenerated

1. http://aminet.net/package/driver/net/prism2v2
2. Install Roadshow (http://roadshow.apc-tcp.de/index-en.php) to Workbench32:, run update if needed
    copy SYS:Storage/NetInterfaces/prism2 Devs:NetInterfaces/
    Follow this, https://lyonsden.net/getting-an-a1200-online-part-2-adding-an-amiga-tcp-ip-stack/
	ed Devs:NetInterfaces/prism2
	And set:
	address=192.168.1.149
	netmask=255.255.255.0
	requiresinitdelay=yes
	#configure=dhcp
	
	Then, additionally (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nDWK7COpQ) updated devs:internet/name_resolution to
	add nameservers for 192.168.1.125
	AND ed Devs:Internet/routes
	DEFAULT=192.168.1.254

  This can now be tested with `wirelessmanager prism2.device` in one shell and `addnetinterface prism2`. And then AmiSpeedTest will let you test the interface.
