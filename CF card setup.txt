# Partitioning the drive

1GB for workbench, 15GB for WHDload, Rest of files
See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78bweS8-DsU&t=14s

1. Get Workbench 3.1 Disks
2. Get the x-bench PC files (https://www.dropbox.com/s/dup6b8y22kmz8yx/x-bench%20setup%20PC%20folder.zip?dl=0)
3. In winUAE add a basic w3.1 install to boot with initially (C:\Users\Public\Documents\Amiga Files\WinUAE\hdf\basic31.hdf), don't forget to set the filesystem correctly
4. In winUAE add the x-bench directory as a hard disk
5. Boot winUAE
6. Open a shell and Copy the files we need
    PC:scsi.device.43.45 to devs:
	PC:installer to c:
	PC:loadmodule to c:
	PC:setpatch to c:
	PC:lha to c:
	PC:pfs3aio to L:
7. ed start up sequence, add
    c:loadmodule devs:scsi.device.43.45
8. Reset emulation
9. (You must be running as Admin at this point) Back to emulation, remove PC folder and add our physical harddrive, set to . Set it to DH3, use UAE(uaehf.device)
10. Restart the emulator then start the emulation (might take a while)
11. Open Tools -> HDToolBox (might take a while), you may need to change the scsi.device to uaehf.device in the icon config/information
12. Select the device -. "Change Drive Type" -> "Define New..."
13. "Read Configuration", note down
	cylinders: 62041
	heads: 16
	blocks per Track: 63
14. Calculate drive size: 62041*16*63*512 = 32,019,111,936/1024 = 31,268,664/1024 = 30,535/1024 = 29.82Gb
15. First partition needs to be 1gb (approx) 62041/29.82 = 2080cylinder == 1GB partition
16. Hop out and go to "Parition Drive", delete left hand partition. Select 1st partition and tick "Advanced Options"
17. Set drive:
	Start Cyl: 2
	End Cyl: 2081
18. Click 'Add/Upadte' -> "Add New File System...". Edit to 'l:pfs3aio'. Set DosType '0x50465303'. Then click Ok
19. Click "Change...", change the "File System:" to 'PFS\03. ChangeM MaxTransder "0x1fe00", click ok.
20. Change first partition to 'DH0' and ensure is bootable.
21. Now make new partitions with similar logic. Click "New Partition", 15GB = 2080*10 = 20,800cylinders
22. Click ok. click "Save changes to drives" (do them all). Click Exit to leave HDtoolBox
23. Restart emulation
24. You can now format the drives, and give them names. Quick format given the size.
