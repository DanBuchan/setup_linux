# Partitioning the drive

1GB for workbench, 15GB for WHDload, Rest of files
See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78bweS8-DsU&t=14s

1. Get Workbench 3.2 Disks
2. boot with install (as the HDtools is there)
3. For HDTools, Ensure device type is scsi.device
9. (You must be running as Admin at this point) Add the physical harddrive, set to . Set it to commodore A1200 IDE
10. Restart the emulator then start the emulation (might take a while)
11. Open Tools -> HDToolBox (might take a while), you may need to change the scsi.device to uaehf.device in the icon config/information
12. Select the device -. "Change Drive Type" -> "Define New..."
13. "Read Configuration", note down
	cylinders: 62041
	heads: 16
	blocks per Track: 63
14. Calculate drive size: 62041*16*63*512 = 32,019,111,936/1024 = 31,268,664/1024 = 30,535/1024 = 29.82Gb
15. First partition needs to be 1gb (approx) 62041/29.82 = 2080cylinder == 1GB partition
16. Hop out and go to "Parition Drive", delete left hand partition. Select 1st partition and tick "Advanced Options"
17. Set drive:
	Start Cyl: 2
	End Cyl: 2081
20. Change first partition to 'DH0' and ensure is bootable.
21. Now make new partitions with similar logic. Click "New Partition", 15GB = 2080*15 = 31,200cylinders
22. Click ok. click "Save changes to drives" (do them all). Click Exit to leave HDtoolBox
23. Restart emulation
24. You can now format the drives, and give them names. Quick format given the size.

# Now install WB32 in the new 1GB partition

2. Restart the installer to install MMUlibs
