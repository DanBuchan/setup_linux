# $VER: routes 1.1 (24.10.2010)
#
# Routes which should be established when the protocol stack
# initializes itself. Each line corresponds to a route which should
# be established, very much like the parameters passed to the
# AddNetRoute command. The template is:
#
#  DST=DESTINATION/K,HOSTDST=HOSTDESTINATION/K,NETDST=NETDESTINATION/K,
#  VIA=GATEWAY/K,DEFAULT=DEFAULTGATEWAY/K
#
# You must either specify the default route, or specify a route with a
# destination address. Note that no duplicates are allowed, i.e. there
# can be only a single default route and the same route may not be
# established twice.
#default localhost
