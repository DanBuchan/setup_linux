# $VER: name_resolution 1.2 (29.3.2020)
#
# This file is used by the name resolution process which associates
# raw IP addresses with domain names and the other way round. You
# can configure the addresses of the domain name system servers to
# use and how the lookup process will translate host names you provide
# before they are looked up.

# You can specify the IP addresses of up to three domain name system
# servers which will be queried in the order you provide here. Each
# line must start with 'nameserver' and then must be followed by
# an IP address.
nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 192.168.1.254

# If a host name is to be looked up which has no trailing domain
# name attached, a default domain name can be appended to it
# prior to lookup
#domain name.com

# You can configure the list of host names for lookup. The search list
# is normally determined from the local domain name; by default, it
# begins with the local domain name, then successive parent domains that
# have at least two components in their names will be searched. This may
# be changed by listing the desired domain search path following the 'search'
# keyword with spaces or tabs separating the names. Up to six domain
# names may be listed.
#search my.first.domain my.second.domain

# The 'sortlist' parameter allows addresses returned by the name
# resolution process to be sorted. A sortlist is specified by IP address
# netmask pairs. The netmask is optional and defaults to the natural
# netmask of the net. The IP address and optional network pairs are separated
# by slashes. Up to 10 pairs may be specified.
#sortlist 130.155.160.0/255.255.240.0 130.155.0.0

# The dynamic configuration process for network interfaces (DHCP) may
# provide a set of domain name system servers. These dynamically-configured
# servers will always be consulted first before the statically-configured
# servers are queried. These statically-configured servers are set up in
# this file through the 'nameserver' configuration entries.
#
# You may prefer to use the statically-configured servers over the
# dynamically-configured servers, e.g. because they may be slower or
# unreliable. If this is the case, use the 'prefer static' option
# below, instead of the 'prefer dynamic' (the default).
#prefer static
prefer dynamic
